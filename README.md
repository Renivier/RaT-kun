# RaT-kun
RaT-kun is a fun custom discord bot that is mostly based on economy features. In this repo, I have experimented 5 things. 1- OOP, 2- Command Handling, 3- Economy Features, 4- Some useful helper functions, 5- Only one file for commands.  Further improvements for later; moving to a db, modularizing, and new features.
